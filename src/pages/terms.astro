        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          These terms govern your use of the Dither & Etch website
          (ditherandetch.ca). By accessing or using this site, you agree to
          these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a portfolio and commission-based creative services website
          operated by Dither & Etch in British Columbia, Canada.
        </p>

        <h2>What This Site Is</h2>
        <p>
          Dither & Etch is a portfolio showcasing custom laser engraving work.
          We accept bespoke commissions — each project is unique and priced
          individually based on scope, materials, and complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>This is not an online store.</strong> We don't sell products directly
          through this website. All commissions begin with a conversation via email.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Commission Process</h2>
        <p>
          If you're interested in a custom piece, reach out via email at
          <a href="mailto:hello@ditherandetch.ca">hello@ditherandetch.ca</a>.
          We'll discuss your project, provide a quote, and agree on terms before
          any work begins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commission terms, pricing, timelines, and payment details are handled
          individually and agreed upon in writing (typically via email) before
          work commences. Those specific agreements govern each commission —
          these website terms don't override them.
        </p>
