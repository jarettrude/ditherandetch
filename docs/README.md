Bespoke laser engraving and custom commissions from British Columbia, Canada.

**Dither** represents the halftone and stippled patterns that bring images to life through precise
laser engraving techniques. **Etch** embodies the crisp, clean lines that define our signature
style.

We specialize in custom commissions—no mass-produced items, no Etsy-style reproductions. Each piece
is uniquely crafted using CO2 laser technology (40-45W) on materials like wood, acrylic, and
leather.

## What We Do

- Custom laser engraving commissions
- Bespoke artwork and personalization
- Material exploration and creative problem-solving
- One-of-a-kind pieces that tell your story

## Technical Implementation

This website includes custom implementations of classic image processing algorithms adapted for
laser engraving:

- **Dithering algorithms**: Floyd-Steinberg, Stucki, and other error diffusion techniques
- **Image adjustments**: Brightness, contrast, gamma correction, and sharpening
- **Background removal and contour detection** for preparing engraving-ready artwork

These are original implementations of well-known algorithms, optimized for laser engraving
workflows.
